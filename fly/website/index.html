  <h1>FORTH <img src="image/heart.gif" height="30px"/> YAML</h1>

  <p>Fly is a object-oriented programming language based on FORTH and YAML.
  It is an exceptionally powerful blend of form and function.
  </p>

  <p>PLEASE NOTE! Fly is ALPHA status. The specification and this website
     are under construction and changing rapidly.</p>

  <br/>

  <h1>YAML in Form</h1>

  <p>YAML ain't markup language. Indeed, YAML is in fact a data serialization syntax.
     And as anyone knows from Lisp, code is data. Which is exactly what FLy
     explots by organizing code into YAML data structures, specifically
     mappings. Fly uses YAML to define prototype object structures.</p>

  <p>Only one variation to the current YAML 1.1 standard is neccessary to support Fly.
     FLy requires string interpolation, both internal and from external files. It is
     more suitably defined in the YAML specification then as part of Fly's underlying Forth
     implementation. We hope to get iterpolation into the upcoming 1.2 or 1.3 specs.
   </p>

  <br/>

  <h1>FORTH in Function</h1>

  <p>Fly uses a <b>variant</b> of Forth. It differs in some important ways:<p>

    <ul>
      <li>Few non-alphanumeric words</li>
      <li>Uniquely object-oriented</i>
      <li>Supports collection and string types</li>
    </ul>

  <p>Fly's Forth variation, like Forth itself, uses postfix notation.
     Most people are not used to this syntax
     having been taught infix and prefix notations in school.
     Yet postfix notation has some clear advantages once the initial
     accustomization is made. It has a naturally object-oriented in
     that objects must be given prior to an operation. Indeed, Fly is in
     effect "polyobject-oriented". And it naturally applies to stack-based
     computation which is highly effcient and suitable equally to
     low-level programming as it is high-level.</p>

  <br/>

  <h1>Hello Word Example</h1>

  <p>Getting started with Fly will be increadibly easy. In fact, if you are currently
     familiar with YAML and Forth, it's should be almost trivial. The main learning
     curve comes from familiarizing oneself with the variation of words Fly uses and
     the libraries available.</p>

  <p>Here's the traditional example of Hello World written in Fly.</p>

  <pre>
    # The traditional Hello World progam

    --- !fly-program

    main: !fn
      "Hello, World!" console.print


    <b>&gt; Hello, World!</b>
  </pre>

  <p>To learn more about Fly's syntax have a look at the <a href="overview.html">overview</a> page.</p>

  <h1>Support</h1>

  <p>Interested in Fly and have good programming skills in Assembly, C and/or Forth?
     We could really use your help.</p>
